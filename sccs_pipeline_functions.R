# 1. Fixed time window

# - unneeded arguments: vnr_info=NA, atc_codes$DAILY_DOSE=NA
# - purchases are combined if the following one is made within fixed time (psize+tolerance)
# - if no following purchase is made, assume fixed purchase length (psize)
# 2. Fixed tablet count
# - necessary arguments: ignore_psize=FALSE, vnr_info, tolerance
# - unneeded arguments: psize=NA
# - takes total number of tablets from vnr_info and assumes fixed number of tablets per day (DAILY_DOSE)
# - purchases are combined if the following one is made within previous
# purchase size (PLKM*PKOKO/DAILY_DOSE + tolerance)
